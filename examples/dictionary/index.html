        <h3>Accessibility (a11y)</h3>

        > Accessibility (a11y) is a measure of how accessible a computer system is to all people, including those with disabilities
        or impairments. It concerns both software and hardware and how they are configured in order to enable a disabled or
        impaired person to use that computer system successfully.

        <h3>(HTML) Attribute</h3>

        > An **attribute** extends a tag, changing its behavior or providing metadata. An attribute always has the form `name=value`
        (the attribute's identifier followed by its associated value). ```html
        <input type="number" min="0" max="1" step="0.1" /> ``` *This HTML code represents a form input field, that must contain a number from 0 to 1. It iterates in 0.1 steps.
        `type`, `min`, `max` and `step` are attributes.*

        > JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. > Every time a web page
        does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at—displaying timely content updates,
        interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that JavaScript is probably
        involved.

        <h3>TypeScript (TS)</h3>

        TypeScript is a superset of [JavaScript](#javascript-js) that is compiled into plain JavaScript that can be interpreted by
        any browser. TypeScript its self cannot be interpreted by browsers, so it is a kind of dialect of JavaScript. A typical
        new feature is to *type-set* variables: ```ts const foo: string[] // type-setting `foo` to an array of strings const
        foo = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'] // setting value of `foo` ```
